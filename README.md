Speedcubing Tracker (name WIP) is a web-based replacement for the PB excel sheet that many people use to track their Cubing Personal Bests. It supports both WCA and Non-WCA events, and can sync up to your WCA profile.

Since the web app is currently in development, planned features are -
Saving to Google Drive and Local Storage so you can access and edit your records even when offline
becoming a PWA (progressive web app)
visually displaying your records
