# About TimeSpace

TimeSpace is a web-based replacement for the PB excel sheet that many people use to track their Cubing Personal Bests.

Often people track their Rubik's Cube (and other related puzzles) records in a speadsheet, but I found this to be inelegant, so I made TimeSpace. TimeSpace can manage all of your records and publicly display your speedcubing accomplishments and records in one place, in a much more aesthetically pleasing form than a spreadsheet.
It also can connect to your WCA profile so everything is in one place.

TimeSpace is built with Nextjs, written in Typescript, with React and Tailwind on the frontend, and Prisma ORM connecting to an AWS deployed Prostgres DB, and Next's RESTful api routes on the backend.
